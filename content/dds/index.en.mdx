<!-- Overview -->

<ArticleOverview>
    <Sunnary>
        Digima, a web-based CRM application, provides small to medium size companies with a way to understand their customers' needs. 
        A few months after I joined the company, we came to a realization: Digima was getting harder and harder to scale. It got so bad that the decision was made to rebuild the product from the ground up.
    </Sunnary>
    <Problems>
        <ul>
            <li>The company needed a more scalable way to deliver feature designs.</li>
            <li>Digima users needed a more consistent user experience.</li>
        </ul>        
    </Problems>
    <Goals>
        <ul>
            <li>Create tools and processes that can deliver quality, consistency, and speed to the design process.</li>
            <li>Redesign the product using these tools.</li>
        </ul>      
    </Goals>
    <Outcomes>
        <ul>
            <li>An entire new design system that included a dedicated documentation site was created.</li>
            <li>Feature design quality, consistency, and delivery time were significantly imporved.</li>
        </ul>        
    </Outcomes>

#### Inventory And Audit
## The product audit revealed many inconsistencies and user experiences issues, confirming the need for a design system.

<p>
 To understand the needs of the redesign, I first had to evaluate the current product. 
</p>

<p>
To that end, I went through the entire product interface and took screenshots of menus, buttons, and modals. I created a Google spreadsheet where I grouped each component into categories and gave each one a name.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["inventory-spreadsheet"]}/>

<p>
Viewing all the components side by side confirmed why we needed a redesign. There were 130 different colors, 56 different shades of greys, 22 different font sizes and 4 completely different variants of search fields. 
</p>

<p>
It became clear that what we needed was a well organized, collaborative design system custom-built to meet the company’s needs.

#### Design Principles
## Agreeing on what kind of product experience we wanted to deliver to our users helped us stay on track when making difficult decisions.

<p>
Before I could start exploring visual directions for the new design, the team and I needed to decide on our core principles. 
</p>

<p>
These core principles are meant to act as our north star when making difficult product decisions and are the basis around which the product should be built.
</p>

<p>
After a few discussions, we came up with the following four principles.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Be purposeful:</strong> Always design with intention and seek to validate your solutions with data when possible.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide clarity:</strong> Ensuring consistent, cohesive user experiences by applying the same solutions to the same problems. Changing patterns and workflows familiar to existing users only when doing so is a definite improvement. (consistency trump originality and coherence trump consistency).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Design Iteratively:</strong> No one solution will be perfect the first time. Be patient, learn from feedback, and improve user experience Iteratively.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Foster collaboration:</strong> Software development is a team sport. A design cannot exist without the support of others, so learning to implicate them into your process will only make for better designs.</li>
</ul>


#### Visual Direction
## Before I could start redesigning the product and building the design system, we needed to decide on a visual direction.

<p>
Once we had an idea of what kind of product experience we wanted to deliver, I started iterating on a few potential design directions for the main screens of the application. 
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["visual-direction-01"]} captions="An early version of the new table design."/>

<Images name={props.images.md["visual-direction-02"]} captions="A variation on the web tracking page."/>

<p>
After a few rounds of feedbacks, the team and I ultimately selected one final style. 
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["visual-direction-final-01"]} captions="The final design style." className="mt-0"/>


#### Building The Design System Structure
## An agreed-upon and straightforward structure for our design system helped promote the shared understanding necessary to reach our goal of improving efficiency.

<p>
Now that I had an idea of what the overall solution will look like, it was time to get into the details of how the design system will be structured. 
</p>

<p>
I started by organizing and categorizing every component identified during the current product version’s audit. During my conversion with developers, I noticed that often, they were using different names when referring to UI elements. 
</p>

<p>
Since one of the goals of the design system was to create a shared understanding, it was essential to decide on the right names collectively and grouped families of UI components based on their similarities.
</p>

<p>
After a few backs and forths, we came up with the following organization. 
</p>

<Images bg="gray-0" name={props.images.md["master-file-1"]} captions="The design system structure."/>


#### Designing The Components
## Designing the components was a long and meticulous process, but one that will significantly increase feature design quality and delivery time. 

<p>
Once the design system structure was defined, I got to work converting the UI elements listed during the audit phase to the new design style established earlier.
</p>

<p>
To keep changes isolated and performance high, each UI element was created <a href="https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as a single Sketch library.</a> This organization, however, made it difficult to quickly navigate through the entire set, so to address this issue, I also created a master file that acted as an entry point.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["Components-1"]} captions="The design system is organized into 4 main categories."/>

<p>
One of the ways I could fulfill my goal of improving efficiency was to reduce guesswork as much as possible when adding or modifying a component. To that end, I created <a href="https://comvex-jp.github.io/unison-design-system/getting-started/for-designers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a set of templates, rules, and conventions</a>, describing how a component library should be built and maintained. 
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["master-file-2"]} className="mt-5" captions="The master file act as a entry point to the design system to help designers quickly navigate through the entire set of components."/>

<Images name={props.images.md["template-rules"]} captions="To keep the system consistent and easy to use, component states have their own symbols."/>

<Images 
    className="bg-gray-0 p-0" 
    containerType="full" 
    containerWidth="Xl"
    name={props.images.xl["Components"]}
    captions="A small sample of the system's components."
/>


#### Building The Documentation Site
## The documentation site helped the team move from design to implementation quickly by eliminating guess-work.

<p>
To forge a shared understanding of the system between designer and developer and facilitate implementation, we needed a documentation site. With the help of the development team, I started working on creating the website and adding components to it.  
</p>

<p>
To help designers quickly move between the design files and the documentation, I decided to mirror the navigation, structure, and terminology in the Sketch files and the documentation site. I also added a link to the component documentation in the sketch files themselves and a link to the sketch library in the related documentation article.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["documentation-site"]} captions="The documentation site includes a direct link to the design file."/>

<p>
Developers could quickly inspect any component by simply clicking on its preview right from the documentation site itself.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["invision-inspect"]} className="mt-5"/>

<p>
When available, I also made sure to display the react version of a component as well as provide code snippets for it.
</p>

<div className={`${props.style.containedMd} ${props.style.imageWrapper} mt-5`}>
     <Img fluid={props.images.md["live-compoenents"].fluid} alt="Image for the end of article test"/>
    <video className={props.style.videoOverlay} muted autoplay loop>
        <source src="images/vid-test4.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>


#### Conclusion
## Creating a design system was necessary to address the scaling and consistency issues that led to a product redesign. 

<p>
This project turned out to be a massive undertaking spanning more than a year and involving several departments.
</p>

<p>
However, these efforts paid off:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>As a designer</strong>, it allowed me to create mockups in a fraction of the time and with a higher level of precision than ever before; it also taught me the depth and complexity of thinking involved in crafting every little piece of an application’s user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>For developers</strong>, being able to rely on clear documentation and reuse existing patterns allows them to focus on writing tests and efficient code rather than continually tweaking CSS values.</li>
    <li><strong>For the business</strong>, the productivity gains we’ve seen in new feature development have more than justified the investments we made in adopting the system.</li>
</ul>
