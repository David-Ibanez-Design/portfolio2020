#### Context
## Our customers needed a way to connect their email inbox to Digima so that leads replies could be registered in the application.

<p>
With approximately 1.7 million emails sent per month and about 6000 regular users, the Digima email feature was by far the most used feature of the product. 
</p>

<p>
However because email replies could not be registered in Digima, users had no choice but to constantly check their email client for lead replies which lead to obvious inefficiencies and in some cases important information loss. 
</p>

<p>
In addition, the business team was planning to transform the product from a simple CRM that was collecting and displaying contact information to one that would act more like an assistant, giving users useful advices about what lead to reach out to, when and how. The ability of registering customer’ email replies in Digma was going to play an important part in achieve that vision.
</p>

<p>
To address the above described issues, it was decided that a feature allowing allowing users to connect their email inbox to Digima needed to be design and developed. 
</p>

#### Research planning
## Spending time planning the research and defining its goals helped the team and I stay focused throughout the research process.

<p>
Giving the number of users impacted by this feature and its complexity, understanding the problem space as much as possible before any design or development could be initiated was essential.
</p>

<p>
I started that process by defining the research goals. To that end I organized and lead multiple stakeholders meetings during which the team and I worked on verbalizing our assumptions and questions about the feature, its value to the business and the users as well as its perceived goals.
</p>

<p>
Once we gather enough information, themes started to emerge. After some refinement and prioritization I transformed these themes into 2 main research goals:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Goal 1</strong>: Understand how users currently use their inboxes</li>
    <li><strong>Goal 2</strong>: Identify technical and user related challanges that would make connecting to inboxes difficult.</li>
</ul>

#### Research Insights
## The various researches unearthed a series of insights that later created important design opportunities. 

<p>
Once the research goals were identified, I them listed questions that needed to be answer under each research goals. Research questions were then matched with one or more research methods such as user interviews, surveys, data analysis, technical investigation and so on. This process ensured that research efforts were inline with business and user goals.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the researches key applicable findings:
</p>


<p><b>From the interviews I found out that: </b> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 out of 7 interviewees didn’t know what their email provider were or even what the term “email provider” actually meant</li>
        <li>All interviewee had at least 2 different email addresses. The most common setup was an email address named after it owner and use to interact with leads and an info@../contact@.. email address dedicated to new leads. This email address is usually shared within the company</li>
    </ul>


<p><b>From the survey I found out that: </b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Almost all participants were highly engaged with their inboxes. 97.6% reported that they checked it multiple times a day, more than 60% reported using some kind of management system (folders, labels etc…).</li>
        <li>60% of users had their inbox set up by a co-worker or an external company</li>
    </ul>

<p> <b>From the data analysis research, I found out that: </b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>35.2% of users used email providers with predictable SMTP/IMAP/POP settings that can be pre-set automatically</li>
        <li>50.6% of users used providers that require custom server names that cannot be predicted</li>
        <li>89% of accounts had a main email address domain that was used by most of it users</li>
        <li>Previous surveys shown that 84% of users were using either Outlook, Gmail or Thunderbird as their email client</li>
    </ul>

<p> <b>From the technical investigation, I found out that:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Connecting Gmail users using Google’s dedicated sign-in API required a yearly paid security audit</li>
    <li>Importing user email server settings from their email client was estimated as technically challenging and time consuming to implement and maintain</li>
</ul>

<section id="challenges" data-title="Challenges">

#### Challenges
## Identify potential challenges was essential so that along with insights gather from the various researches, they could be used to inform future design solutions.

<p>
Based on the research and stakeholder meetings, I identified the following challenges:
</p>

<p> <b>From the business team: </b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The product team wanted to release the feature as soon as possible to catch-up with competitors.</li>
    </ul>

<p> <b>From the users</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The research shown that most users had little to no knowledge on what email providers they were using or what their email servers settings were.</li>
    </ul>

<p> <b>From the developement team</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The variety of email providers to support as well as the tight deadline were identified as the main challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p> <b>From the design team (me)</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Finding ways to help non tech-savvy users connect to their inboxes was the number one challange.</li>
</ul>

<section id="problem-statement" data-title="Problem Statement">

#### Problem statement
## Clearly describing the issues I was trying to address early on, helped me stay focused on the most challenging part of the design.

<p>
After gathering research finding and defining challenges, I decided to synthesize those insights into a simple problem statement so that design goals could be clearly identified and communicated to the whole team.
</p>

<p>
“How might we design a feature that would allow non-technically savvy users to connect their inbox to Digima by themselves, while minimizing impact on development time”.
</p>

</section>

<section id="ideation" data-title="Ideation">

#### Ideation
## Using the insight gathered from the research, I them started iterating on a few design solutions.

<p>
With the design goals clearly defined and the research insights in mind, I them started to sketch a few potential design solutions.
</p>

<p>
One of my early ideas was to leverage email providers login APIs when available to allow users to connect their inbox to Digima without requiring them to enter any server settings.
</p>

<p>
However this solution had to be abandon for 2 reasons:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A technical investigation into the feasibility of such system revealed that provider sign-in required a paid yearly security audit for Google that was too expensive for the company</li>
    <li>User research indicated that users didn’t know what provider they were using and so asking them to select a provider might not had work</li>
</ul>

<Images 
    withZoom
    className="bg-gray-0" 
    containerType="full" 
    containerWidth="Xl" 
    name={props.images.xl["iteration-v1"]}
/>

<p>
Since I couldn’t ask users to select an email provider or use providers’s sign-in APIs I needed to find another way to help users find their email settings. 
</p>

<p>
According to the research, 84% of users were using either Outlook, Gmail or Thunderbird as their email client. Since these tools were storing the same email setting information we needed to connect Digima to user’s inboxes, my next idea was to build a feature that would detect the user client and try to import these setting directly into Digima.
</p>

<p>
The development team however estimated that this feature althgout feasible, would require a significant amount of time to build and maintain especially giving the fact that clients like Outlook had mutiple versions.
</p>

    withZoom
    className="bg-gray-0" 
    containerType="full" 
    containerWidth="Xl" 
    name={props.images.xl["iteration-v2"]}
/>

<p>
Taking advantage of the fact that the same email domain was used by a majority of users within a given account, I finally settled on a version that would allow users or the support team to set account-wide email server settings that users could automatically use to connect user's inbox to Digima during the user inbox connection process.
</p>

<p>
The minority of users who knew their email settings could still manually add them.
</p>

<p>
For users who didn’t have access to account level server settings, a dedicated support article was created to help users find them using their email client.
</p>

<section id="usability-test" data-title="Usability test">

#### Usability test
## Our testing sessions uncovered a series of usability issues that I were later able to fix.

<p>
Once I was confident that the version I designed was meeting our goals, I set out to validate my assumptions by testing them with real users.
</p>

<p>
To that end, I created a fully functional HTML/CSS/Jquery prototype of the user setting flow that we tested with 5 participants recruted from our exsiting user base.
</p>

<div className={props.style.containedMd}>
    <div className={props.style.imageWrapper}>
        <video className={props.style.videoCentered} muted autoplay loop>
            <source style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="images/inbox-prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video> 
    </div>
    <figcaption className={props.style.caption}>Building an HTML/CSS/jQuery prototype helped identify issues that a static version could not have otherwise revealed.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>
During the test, participants were asked to go through part of the inbox set-up process while verbalizing their thoughts. Some follow-up questions such as “why” , “what do you think of this function” , “tell me more about that”, were asked to try to get users to elaborate on their feelings and rate their experience for each step of the process. 
</p>

<p>
The testing sessions uncovered a series of usability issues that I was able to fix and validate with further testing.
</p>

<Images withZoom name={props.images.md["user-testing-spreadsheet"]} captions="Results of each session were consolidated into a Google spreadsheet for further analysis."/>

<p>
For instance, in the initial design, some participants didn’t noticed the help link that was suppose to open a separate support page with a step by step guide on how to setup their email settings and therefore couldn’t complete the form. 
</p>

<p>
Changing the link into a banner, displaying the help link in error and warning messages as well as moving the help page from the support site directly into the application seems to fix the issue for most participants.

<section id="high-fidelity-mock-ups"  data-title="High fidelity mock-ups">

#### High fidelity mock-ups
## To maintain consistency and facilitate implementation I made sure to reuse as many existing patterns as possible.

<p>
After the team and I were satisfied with the usability test results and the prototype, I shifted my focus on the high fidelity version of the design.
To facilitate implementation and help meet the deallines set by the business team, I made sure to reuse as many design components as possible in my final design.
</p>

<p>
When existing patterns could not be used, I documented them in our dedicated  <Link to={"/dds"}>design system documentation site.</Link>
</p>

<Images withZoom name={props.images.md["centered-documentation"]} captions="Documenting new UI components in our dedicated site, helped imporve implementation time by reducing guesswork."/>

<p>
Finally, in addition to the prototype used during testing an invision prototype was also created to help the development, QA and business teams understand how the final version of the design should look and behave as a whole.
</p>

<section id="implementation" data-title="Implementation">

#### Implementation
## Each part of the design was broken down into individual user stories and spread over multiple sprints.

<p>
In addition to the prototypes and the hight fidelity mockups, I broke down the design into more then 50 user stories that were then distributed into multiple sprints.
</p>

<p>
During the whole implementation process, I regularly met with the developers and business teams to make sure that the deadlines could be met, and if not that the appropriate adjustments were made. 
</p>

<section id="conclusion" data-title="Conclusion">

#### Conclusion
### 3 months after the feature release, 65% of users sucssuflly connected their inboxes and emails sending were up by 25%.
<p>
For users it meant that they wouldn't have to constantly switch between their email client and Digima and didn’t have to worry about missing important lead information. 
For the business, having a large number of users connected to their inbox meant that reply data could be used to build advice based features in the future.
</p>

### A well plan and carefully documented research process help me and the team stay on track.
<p>
For this feature, I made sure that each step of the research process was plan ahead of time and carefully documented. This made the process easly sharable with the team and helped me stay focused on the research goals.
</p>

### Efforts to make the research process more efficient should be made.
<p>
Even though the insights gather from the research were instrumental in designing a feature that help us met our goals, the overall process took almost 2 months from planning to final recommendations. This meant that I had less time was sepnt on iteration and design. 
</p>

### Taking the time to build a simple proof-of-concept would have helped reduced last minute changes.
<p>
Even thought we conducted a lots of technical investigations during the research and design phase, there were still a lot of detail missing and that ended-up causing issues during development. A sinple proof of concept would have probably helped us reduce risks even further.
