<!-- Overview -->

<ArticleOverview>
    <Sunnary>
        Digima is a web-based CRM launched in 2018 with the mission of providing businesses with a way to understand their customers' needs and behaviors. 
        In order to fulfill that mission, the product needed to provide users with a more efficient way to communicate with their prospects than the existing emails and calls channels. 
    </Sunnary>
    <Problems>
        <p>Digima customers were already using emails and calls to engage with their prospects, However, many of them found that their email messages and phone calls were left unanswered.</p>
    </Problems>
    <Goals>
        <p>We need to provide our customers with a way to increase their prospects’ engagement and conversion rates.</p>
    </Goals>
    <Outcomes>  
        <ul>
            <li>A two-way SMS feature was introduced to the existing product.</li>
            <li>We saw an increase in customer's prospects engagement and conversion rates. </li>           
        </ul>
    </Outcomes>

#### Problem Statement
## Our customers needed a new, more efficient communication channel to engage with their prospects.
<p>
One of the most important business goals of our customers is to meaningfully engage propestect to propel them to purchase their services. 
</p>

<p>
Consumers today have been solicited by advertising more than they ever have and breaking through that noise requires advertisers to reach consumers in the ways they prefer.
</p>

<p>
With an average email opening rate and a cold call reached rate between 10 to 15 percent, our customers needed a more efficient communication channel.
</p>

<p>
It was decided that SMS, with its high opening and click-through rate, was the feature our customers needed to achieve their goals.
</p>

#### Scope and Constraints
## From the start of the project, it was clear that a lot of efforts will be spent working around the 3rd party API restrictions.

<p>
When I started working on the project, a 3rd party SMS provider had already been chosen and a draft document detailing the overall feature goals, and functionalities had been written by the project manager. 
</p>

<p>
My first task was to study that document and meet with team leaders to discuss the project. Since we were relying on an external API, it was also essential to identify constraints related to that service early in the process. Below are the main constrained we identified:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>All SMS sent to the Softbank provider was limited to 200 per day. SMS over that limit will not be sent.</li>
    <li>Since a single SMS could only contain 70 characters, the decision was made to allow up to 4 separate SMS to be sent at the same time.</li>
    <li>Because of scheduling issues, the Backend team could not investigate the API and the API itself had no documentations.</li>
    <li>To be able to send and receive SMS a dedicated phone number needed to be manually issued.</li>
</ul>

#### User Flow
## Laying out the feature’s user flow allowed the team and I to identify where we needed to focus our efforts and spend most of our time.

<p>
Because of the scale and complexity of the project, one of the most important early steps in the design process was to make sure the team had a shared understanding of the overall feature. However, at that point, all we had was a draft specification document. 
</p>

<p>Building a user flow, allows the team and I to lay down the entire feature functionalities in detail. In addition to getting everybody on the same page, It also allowed us to quickly identify potential issues and iterate upon possible solutions. </p>

    name={props.images.xl["full-User-flow"]}
/>


<p>
One example of this was the feature activation process. Because a phone number needed to be manually issued before the SMS feature could be used, we needed to agree on a flow that was efficient but also flexible enough to account for the fact that some parts of the process couldn’t be automated. We also needed to let users know about the status of their requests in real-time. 
</p>

#### Wireframe
## It was crucial to maintain users’ sense of control over what message they were sending despite all of the existing API restrictions.

<p>
Once I felt that the team and I had answered as many questions as we could with the user flow, I started working on each individual screen.
</p>

<p>
I created a series of wireframes, focusing first on the screens that were identified as being the most challenging ones. The goal was to spend most of my time iterating on these, knowing that screens displaying tables for instance could be easily designed by <Link to={"/dds"}>reusing existing elements from our design system.</Link>
</p>

<p>
One example of a challenging screen was the SMS creation screen. Because of the 3rd party API restrictions, it was crucial to make sure that users understood that the recipient(s) of the SMS will receive 4 separate SMS on their devices and that therefore, they should write their SMS messages accordingly. 
</p>

    name={[props.images.md["centered-Creation-screen-iteration-1"], props.images.md["centered-Creation-screen-iteration-2"], props.images.md["centered-Creation-screen-iteration-3"]]}
/>

<p>
After a few iterations, I settled on a 2 column-style layout with one column displaying a series of textareas where users could input and manage their SMS messages, and the other displaying a real-time preview of the SMS on the recipient device.

#### High Fidelity Mockup
## To maintain consistency and facilitate implementation I made sure to reuse as many existing patterns as possible.

<p>
Continuing my strategy of focusing my time and efforts on the most challenging functionalities first, I started by creating high fidelity mockups for the SMS creation screens and the chats functionality.
</p>

<p>
During that process, I made sure to reused as many existing design patterns from our design system as possible to maintain consistency and facilitate implementation.
</p>

<p>
When existing patterns could not be used, I documented new UI components in our dedicated site.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["full-Final-design-02"]} captions="The final version of the SMS chat list screen."/>

<p>
Once screens for the most important scenarios were designed, an invision prototype was created and shared with the team. The prototype helped the team understand how the final version of the design will look and behave as a whole.

## Conclusion
### Basing my decisions on first-hand knowledge is essential when working with external services.
<p>
Because of scheduling issues, the Backend team couldn’t review the 3rd party API early in the project, therefore we had to rely on second-hand information about the API scope and limitations during most of the design process.
This could have led to significant project delays if the information we had turned out to be wrong. Thankfully it wasn’t the case. After the project was finished the team decided to learn from that experience and made sure to involve the Backend team early in the design process when necessary.
</p>
<br/>

### Focusing on solving the most challenging problems first made my design process more efficient.
<p>
As a designer sometimes I had a tendency to start by designing solutions to problems I knew could be solved with little effort because it gives me a sense of progression early on. This project, however, showed me that starting by focusing on the most challenging problems first, ultimately made for a better and more efficient design process because I didn’t have to constantly re-think my solutions as I was discovering additional challenges along the way.
</p>
<br/>

### The feature has proven to be a huge success with customers growing to 20% adoption and increasing the overall product MRR by 10%, 6 month after release.
<p>
Customers have also reported that SMS sent to contacts had a higher engagement rate than emails. For our customers this meant a higher chance of closing a deal. For the business this meant more recurring revenue to support future product developments.
