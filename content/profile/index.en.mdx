            Digima, a web-based CRM application, aim to provide small to medium size companies with a way to understand their customers' needs.
            The contact profile page plays a key role in fulfilling that objectif. In a single view, the page provides a large amount of information about contact characteristics, actions, and events. Over time, it had accumulated a lot of design debs leading to the necessity of a redesign.

<section id="problem-statement" data-title="Problem Statement">

#### Problem Statement
## A year after the product launch, we came to a realization: we were adding features to the product faster than the interface could handle.

<p>
As a CRM, Digima contact’s profile page is the central hub for all our customer’s lead interaction, and because of this, new features ended up adding UI elements to the page in some way or another.
After a while, the profile page became cluttered and we were starting to run out of place.
</p>

<p>
Not only that was inconvenient to our users, but it was also slowing our development cycle down because I had to figure out where to place these new elements on the page and how to promote discovery for each of them.
</p>

<p>
Our users noticed these issues as well, and over the lifetime of the page, we saw an increase of support tickets and feedbacks asking how to perform certain tasks, where a specific feature was located on the page, as well as requests for improvement.  
</p>

</section>

<section id="challenges" data-title="Constraints and Challenges">

#### Challenges
## Before discussing any potential changes, It was essential to first identify challenges.

<p>
From the beginning, one thing was clear, redesigning the contact profile page won’t be easy.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>It was the most used page both in terms of page views and time spent on a page; therefore, any modification could potentially be highly disruptive to users's daily work. </li>
    <li>The page design needed to account for a variety of use cases and contexts.</li>
    <li>The redesign and its implementation will be a long process which will take resources away from other essential feature developments.</li>
</ul>

<Images name={props.images.md["exsiting-google-analytics"]} captions="Google Analytics's data clearly underscore the importance of the contact profile page for our users."/>
</section>

<section id="user-research" data-title="User Research">

#### User Research
## Most of the issues users were reporting were centered around difficulties finding and identifying important information.

<p>
In order to identify potential design opportunities and improve the current profiles user experience, we first needed to get a detailed understanding of users pain points.
To that end, I worked in collaboration with the support team to collect any previously reported issues. 
</p>
<p>
To get a deeper insight into users pain points, I also participated in several user interviews.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["exsiting-customer-feedback-spreadsheet"]} captions="Customer feedbacks from various sources were centralized and categorized in a dedicated Google spreadsheet."/>

<p>
From that research, I was able to synthesize the data into a customer journey map. This allowed me to represent user pain points and see where we needed to focus our attention.
</p>

<Images 
    containerType="full" 
    className="bg-gray-0" 
    containerWidth="Xl"
    name={props.images.xl["journey-map"]}
    captions="The journey map allowed me to represent user pain points visually and see where we needed to focus our attention."
/>


<p>
The data revealed a variety of pain points that our users frequently faced and confirmed some of my earlier hypothesis. Most of the issues users were reporting were centered around difficulties finding and identifying important contact information.  
</p>

</section>

<section id="objectives" data-title="Redesign Objectives">

#### Objectives
## One of the essential goals of the redesign was to reduce the time users were spending looking for specific information.

<p>
After identifying design challenges and users pain points, it was now time to set some redesign goals. I decided to divide these goals into two categories: some directed at the business and some at the users.
</p>

<p>
For the business:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improve feature implementation speed by making the page more modular and easy to scale.</li>
    <li>Ensure that the implementation of the redesign itself does not get in the way of new features development.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the users:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The redesign should not cause disruptions to users daily work.</li>
    <li>Users ability to find important lead information should be significantly improved.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="ideation" data-title="Ideation">

#### Ideation
## After setting up some redesign goals, it was now time to start sketching a few ideas.

<p>
One of the most commonly reported issues, had to do with feature/information discovery. To me, that was clear sign of a lack of a visual hierarchy within the page.
</p>
<p>
To address that, I first needed to get a clear idea of what UI elements needed to be on the page, what their purpose was and how important each one was to our users. To that end, I listed, categorized and ordered each element based on Google analytics event data and prior user research.
</p>


<Images name={props.images.md["exsiting-sections-break-down"]} captions="Listing each UI element of the page by order of importance helped me to understand their overall hierarchical value."/>


<p>
Once I had a clear idea of what needed to be displayed on the page and the hierarchical value of each of these elements, I started working on the page layout itself.
</p>
<p>
One of the critical goals of that redesign was to reduce the time users were spending looking for specific information. Switching from the current version's 2 columns layout to a 3 columns layout seem like an obvious way to significantly increasing the amount of information visible above the fold.
</p>



<Images 
    containerWidth="Lg"
    name={props.images.md["new-layout"]}
    captions="Switching to a 3 columns layout significantly increasing the amount of information visible above the fold"
/>

<p>
However since displaying too much information could be overwhelming to users, elements on the page needed to be porperly organized. Using the prioritization matrix made earlier, I managed to give the layout some much needed visual hierarchy.
</p>

<Images 
    containerType="full"
    className="bg-gray-0" 
    containerWidth="Lg"
    name={[props.images.lg["new-layout-hierarchy-1"], props.images.lg["new-layout-hierarchy-2"]]}
/>

<p>
Based on the new 3 columns layout, I created a wireframe that I shared with a few team members to gather some early feedback. After a few backs and forth that lead to a few adjustments, I was ready to start the next phase, prototyping.
</p>

<Images 
    containerType="full" 
    className="bg-gray-0" 
    containerWidth="Lg"
    captions="2 column to 3 column layout."
    name={[props.images.lg["new-sketches-wireframes-1"], props.images.lg["new-sketches-wireframes-2"]]}
/>
</section>
<section id="prototyping" data-title="Prototyping">

#### Prototyping
## Building an HTML/CSS/jQuery prototype helped me lower the risks involved in designing such a complex page.

<p>
The prototype highlighted a few issues.
One of them had to do with the timeline. Initially, I thought that placing the timeline at the center of the screen and giving it more screen real estate than the other sections would be enough to highlight recent leads related activities. It turned out that it wasn’t enough. 
</p>

<p>
Internal feedbacks indicated that specific timeline’s information were hard to find. After a few iteration, I decided to only display the main activity type (emails, calls, meetings...) as top-level navigation for the timeline.
</p>

<section id="user-testing" data-title="User Testing">

#### User Testing
## Our testing sessions uncovered a series of unexpected usability issues that we were later able to fix.

<p>
In order to reveal additional usability issues with the new design, we use the newly created prototype to conduct a series of remote usability tests. 
</p>
<Images withZoom name={props.images.md["usability-testing"]} captions="Usability tests were conducted remotely via zoom."/>

<p>
Participants were selected from our existing customer base and were asked to perform a series of tasks while verbalizing their thought process. Some follow-up questions such as “why” , “how do you think of this function” , “tell me more about that”, and questions about the current profile design were asked to try to get users to elaborate on their feelings. We chose to focus on tasks that were both representative of most user's goals and that were related to parts of the UI that had the most design changes. 
</p>
<Images withZoom name={props.images.md["user-testing-spreadsheet"]} captions="Results of each session were consolidated into a Google spreadsheet for further analysis."/>
<p>
Our testing sessions uncovered a series of unexpected usability issues that we were later able to fix.
</p>
<p>
For instance, when asked to remove a contact from a group, most participants were either unable to perform the task or unsure whether they were performing the right one even though they were able to find the appropriate UI elements. Further inquiries reveal that some participants did not understand the relationship between the contact and the group the contact belonged to. 
</p>
<p>
Changing the contact group block title to clearly describe the relationship seems to fix the issue for most participants.
</p>

/>

</section>

<section id="final-design"  data-title="Final Design">

#### Final Design
## I broke down each element of the page into components that I then documented in our existing design system.

<p>
After the team and I were satisfied with the usability test results and the prototype, I set out to build the high fidelity version of the design.
</p>

<p>
One of the challenges was to efficiently communicate to the frontend team how each element of the page was supposed to look and behave.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate implementation, I broke down each element into components that I then documented <Link to={"/dds/"}>in our existing design system documentation website.</Link>
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["dds-components"]} captions="Each page element were documented in our dedicated deisgn system documentation website."/>

 In addition to the HTML prototype created earlier, an invision prototype was also created to give the frontend team a sense of how the final version of the design will look and behave as a whole.
</section>

<section id="implementation" data-title="Implementation And Release Strategy">

#### Implementation
## We needed to come up with an implementation and release strategy that would minimize disruption to both the development of new features and users’ daily work.

<p>
At this point, the redesign was ready to be implemented. However, since one of the redesign goals was to minimize disruption to the development of new features, I decided to break down the redesign integration into separate user stories and spread these out into multiple sprints.
</p>

<p>
This methodology kept the redesign integration going while having minimal impact on higher priority tasks like bug fixes or new features development.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["youtrack-tasks"]} captions="Each elements of the redesign were broken down into a user story and spread out into multiple sprints."/>

<p>
Because the page was the most used page of the whole application, an other essential redesign goal was to minimize disruption to users’ daily work. This meant that we couldn't just “flip the switch” and replace the current design by the new one. We needed a way to progressively expose users to the new design while keeping an eye on their feedbacks to fix any remaining bugs and usability issues.  
</p>

<p>
Therefore, in collaboration with the product manager, we decided to organize the release process into 2 phases: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The alpha phase</strong>, during which the new design was only released to our internal sales team.</li>
    <li><strong>The beta phase</strong>, during which users were automatically switched to the new design with the possibility to revert to the old profile via an opt-out option.</li>
</ul>

<Images withZoom name={props.images.md["release-schedule"]} captions="Progressively exposing users to the new design allow us to minimize disruption to their daily work."/>

<p>
After a few weeks of feedback and bug fixes, we entered the final two weeks of the process, where we warned users that the new profile design would be the default version. 3 months after the start of the beta phase, all users were successfully switched to the new profiled design.
</p>

<Images withZoom name={props.images.md["google-analytics-adoption-rate"]} captions="The new profile adoption rate data were tracked in Google Analytics and Tableau."/>

<Images name={props.images.md["Profile-feedback"]} captions="Customer feedbacks were collected from various sources and managed in a dedicated youtrack board."/>

</section>

<section id="conclusion" data-title="Conclusion">

#### Conclusion

### Static or interactive mockups are not enough when dealing with complex problems.

<p>
Taking the time to create an HTML/CSS/jQuery prototype rather than relying solely on an invision prototype turned out to be crucial in getting some early internal feedback and catching a lot of issues that would have otherwise had to be solved by developers during the implementation phase.
</p>

### Setting business-specific goals Is essential.

<p>
Getting the stakeholder’s buy-in to move forward with this type of redesign proved to be challenging. However, overcoming that obstacle taught me a lot about how to present my ideas to stakeholders and about the necessity to set up business-specific goals.
