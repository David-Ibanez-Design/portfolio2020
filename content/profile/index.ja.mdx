#### Problem Statement
## A year after the product launch, we came to a realization: we were adding features to the product faster than the interface could handle.

<p>
As a CRM, Digima contact’s profile page is the central hub for all our customer’s lead interaction, and because of this, new features ended up adding UI elements to the page in some way or another.
After a while, the profile page became cluttered and we were starting to run out of place.
</p>


<Images name={props.images.md["exsiting-UX-issues"]} captions="A few examples of the exsitig page issues."/>

<p>
Not only that was inconvenient to our users, but it was also slowing our development cycle down because we had to figure out where to place these new elements on the page and how to promote discovery for each of them.
</p>

<p>
Our users noticed these issues as well, and over the lifetime of the page, we saw an increase of support tickets and feedbacks asking how to perform certain tasks, where a specific feature was located on the page, as well as requests for improvement.  
</p>

<section id="constrains" data-title="Constraints and Challenges">

#### Constraints and Challenges
## Before discussing any potential changes, It was essential to first identify potential challenges.

<p>
From the beginning, one thing was clear, redesigning the contact profile page won’t be easy:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>It was the most used page both in terms of page views and time spent on a page; therefore, any modification could potentialy be hightly disruptive to users's daily work. </li>
    <li>The page design needed to account for a variety of use cases and contexts, which was an inherent design challenge.</li>
    <li>Due to a lack of resources, I did not have direct access to users to conduct interviews or perform user testing.</li>
    <li>The redesign will inevitably be a long process.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section id="research" data-title="User Research">

#### User Research
## The goal of the user research was two-fold: evaluating how the current version was performing and finding opportunities for improvement.

<p>
I started the research process by gathering qualitative data. To that end, I worked in collaboration with the support team to collect any profile related issues that could help me identify users pain points. I also spent some time with our internal sales staff that were using the product themselves.
</p>
<p>
I consolided my findings into a Google spreadsheet making sure to categorize each reported issue/requests into one of three categories:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Feature discovery issues. </li>
    <li>Information accessibility issues.</li>
    <li>Bugs. </li>
</ul>

<Images name={props.images.md["exsiting-customer-feedback-spreadsheet"]} captions="Collecting and categorizing all reported issues into a single document helped me find commum solutions for similar issues"/>

<section id="objectives" data-title="Redesign Objectives">

#### Redesign Objectives
## One of the essential goals of the redesign was to reduce the time users were spending looking for specific information.

<p>
After identifying design challanges and users pain points, it was now time to set some redesign goals. I decided to divide these goals into two categories: some directed at the business and some at the users.
</p>

<p>
For the business:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Imporve feature implementation speed by making the page more modular and easy to scale.</li>
    <li>Ensure that the implementation of the redesign itself does not get in the way of new features development.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the users:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The redesign should not get disrupt users daily work.</li>
    <li>Users ability to find lead information should be significantly improved.</li>
    <li>The new design should give users the ability to customize the profile page to their specific needs.</li>
</ul>

<section id="ideation" data-title="Ideation">

#### Ideation
## After setting up some redesign goals, it was now time to start sketching a few ideas.

<p>
One of the most commuly reported issues, had to do with feature/information discovery. To me, that was clear sign of a lack of a visual hierarchy within the page.
</p>
<p>
To adress that, I first needed to get a clear idea of what UI elements were displayed on the page, what were their purpose and hierarchical value and how they related to each other. 
I manage to do that by listing and then laying out the main UI elements of the page in a magic quadrant diagram.
</p>


<Images name={props.images.md["exsiting-sections-break-down"]} captions="Listing each UI element of the page by order of importance allowed me to undestand their overall hierarchical value."/>


<p>
Once I had a clear idea of what needed to be displayed ont the page and the hierarchical value of each of these elements, I started working on the page layout itself.
</p>
<p>
One of the critical goals of that redesign was to reduce the time users were spending looking for specific information. Switching from the current version's 2 column layout to a 3 column layout seem like an obvious way to significantly increasing the amount of information that was visible above the fold.
</p>



<Images 
    containerWidth="Lg"
    name={props.images.md["new-layout"]}
    captions="Switching to a 3 columns layout significantly increasing the amount of information that was visible above the fold"
/>

<p>
However since displaying too much information could be overwhelming to users, elements on the page needed to be porperly organized. Using the magic quadrant diagram made earlier, I managed to give the layout some much needed visual hierarchy.
</p>

<Images 
    containerType="full"
    className="bg-gray-0" 
    containerWidth="Lg"
    name={[props.images.lg["new-layout-hierarchy-1"], props.images.lg["new-layout-hierarchy-2"]]}
/>

<p>
Based on the new 3 columns layout, I created a wireframe that I shared with a few team members to gather some early feedback. After a few backs and forth that leads to a few adjustments, I was ready to go to the next phase, prototyping.
</p>

<Images 
    containerType="full" 
    className="bg-gray-0" 
    containerWidth="Lg"
    captions="2 column to 3 column layout."
    name={[props.images.lg["new-sketches-wireframes-1"], props.images.lg["new-sketches-wireframes-2"]]}
/>

<section id="prototyping" data-title="Prototyping">

#### Prototyping
## Building an HTML/CSS/jQuery prototype helped me lower the risks involved in designing such a complex page.

<p>
The prototype highlighted a few issues.
One of them had to do with the timeline. Initially, I thought that placing the timeline at the center of the screen and giving it more screen real estate than the other sections would be enough to highlight recent leads related activities. It turned out that it wasn’t enough. 
</p>

<p>
Internal feedbacks indicated that specific timeline’s information were hard to find. After a few iteration, I decided to only display the main activity type (emails, calls, meetings...) as top-level navigation for the timeline.
</p>

<section id="finalDesign"  data-title="Final Design">

#### Final Design
## I broke down each element of the page into components that I then documented in our existing design system.

<p>
After the team and I were satisfied with the prototype, I set out to build the high fidelity version of the design.
</p>

<p>
One of the challenges was to efficiently communicate to the frontend team how each element of the page was supposed to look and behave.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate implementation, I broke each element into components that I then documented <Link to={"/articles/design-system"}>in our existing design system documentation website.</Link>
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["dds-components"]} captions="Each page element were documentaed in our dedicated deisgn system documentation website."/>

 In addition to the HTML prototype created earlier, an invision prototype was also created to give the frontend team a sense of how the final version of the design will look and behave as a whole.
</section>

<section id="implementation" data-title="Implementation And Release Strategy">

#### Implementation And Release Strategy
## We needed to come up with an implementation and release strategy that would minimize disruption to both the development of new features and users’ daily work.

<p>
At this point, the redesign was ready to be implemented. However, since one of the redesign goals was to minimize disruption to the development of new features, I decided to break down the redesign integration into separate user stories and spread these out into multiple sprints.
</p>

<p>
This methodology kept the redesign integration going while having minimal impact on higher priority tasks like bug fixes or new features development.
</p>

<Images name={props.images.md["youtrack-tasks"]} captions="Each elements of the redesign were broken down into user story and spreadout into multiple sprints."/>

<p>
Because the page was the most used page of the whole application, an other essential redesign goal was to minimize disruption to users’ daily work. This meant that we couldn't just “flip the switch” and replace the current design by the new one. We needed a way to progressively expose users to the new design while keeping an eye on their feedbacks to fix any remaining bugs and usabilty issues.  
</p>

<p>
Therefore, in collaboration with the product manager, we decided to organize the release process into 2 phases: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>The alpha phase</strong>, during which the new design was only released to our internal sales team.</li>
    <li><strong>The beta phase</strong>, during which users were automatically switched to the new design with the possibility to revert to the old profile via an opt-out option.</li>
</ul>

<Images name={props.images.md["release-schedule"]} captions="Progressivly exposing users to the new design allow us to minimize disruption to their daily work."/>

<p>
After a few weeks of feedback and bug fixes, we entered the final two weeks of the process, where we warned users that the new profile design would be the default version with no possibility to revert to the old one. Two months after the start of the beta phase, all users were successfully switched to the new profiled design.
</p>

<section id="conclusion" data-title="Conclusion">

## Conclusion
### Little research is better than no research at all.

<p>
Not being able to reach out to our users directly or to perform user testing was frustrating. However, this project showed me that even a small amount of qualitative data could help inform the final design. This, in turn, left me eager to learn more about ways I could integrate more data into my design process. 
</p>

### Static or interactive mockups are not enough when dealing with complex problems.

<p>
Taking the time to create an HTML/CSS/jQuery prototype rather than relying solely on an invision prototype turned out to be crucial in getting some early internal feedback and catching a lot of issues that would have otherwise had to be solved by developers during the implementation phase.
</p>

### Setting business-specific goals Is essential.

<p>
Getting the stakeholder’s buy-in to move forward with this type of redesign proved to be challenging. However, overcoming that obstacle taught me a lot about how to present my ideas to stakeholders and about the necessity to set up business-specific goals.
